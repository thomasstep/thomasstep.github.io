## Introduction

Hello there. My name is Thomas Step. I am a software engineer and creator of [many projects](/projects). I mainly work on backend and devops projects, but I have been teaching myself the frontend side of web development lately. I mostly code in Javascript/Node (because, you know, full stack), but I also know Python, Go, C/C++, Ruby, and some other lower level languages. My motivation to create and maintain this site is so that I can [translate what I am learning into my own words](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579). One of my mentors from an internship brought this thought up to me, I decided to run with it, and now here we are. The topics that I write about are heavily influenced on what I am currently working on and interested in. The content will probably change throughout time, but at a high level I am interested in full stack web development and devops.

I build in public and have contributed to open source. Some of my posts pertain to what I have built and learned while building it. If there are any posts on here that you would like to know more about, drop me a line. Same goes if you just want to talk and learn about what I am currently working on. I am open to collaboration as long as our values align.
