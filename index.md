Hello there. My name is Thomas Step. I am a software engineer who mainly works on backend APIs, but I have been teaching myself the frontend side of web development. I mostly code in Javascript/Node, but I also know C/C++, Python, Ruby, and some other lower level languages. My motivation to create and maintain this site is so that I can [translate what I am learning into my own words](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579). One of my mentors from an internship brought this thought up to me and I decided to run with it. Here we are. The topics that I write about are heavily influenced on what I am currently working on and interested in. The content will probably change throughout time, but at a high level I am interested in full stack web development and devops.

I build in public and have contributed to open source. Some of my posts pertain to what I have built and learned while building it. If there are any posts on here that you would like to know more about, drop me a line. Same goes if you just want to talk and learn about what I am currently working on. I am open to cooperation as long as our values align.

[Go to my projects page](/projects) to learn about what I have worked on in the past.
