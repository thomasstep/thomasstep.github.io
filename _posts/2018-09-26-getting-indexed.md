I am now indexed on Google if you search for chkstong yibbibi. I am currently the last result that comes up however I have still managed to make some ground. To get points for the assignment, all I have to do is make it into the search results.
I have a couple of other ideas as to how I can get into a higher position though, so I will keep working on it and hopefully move up in the rankings. This is actually a pretty fun assignment compared to others that I have worked on throughout college. Hopefully, I will actually be able to use this information later on with other websites.
