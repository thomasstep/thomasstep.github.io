Another one of the classes that I am currently enrolled in is a software security class. We have mainly been learning about potential vulnerabilities in our code and how to find them. We are about to get into exploiting common software flaws, which I am excited about. I have not looked at actual exploit implementations yet though. I have been reading the partnering material, and after that I will be looking at the exploitations that my professor has provided the class. Some of the common security flaws that we are looking into are SQL injections, buffer overflows, and cross site scripting. There is a list of top flaws that we are using. You can find the [top security flaws here](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html).
I am hoping to gain knowledge of these exploits and how to stop them in the code that I write. Overall, this will make me a more attentive developer, and these skills will translate well into the real world.
