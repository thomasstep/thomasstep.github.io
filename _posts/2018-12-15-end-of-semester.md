My second-to-last semester has ended. My favorite class this semester was Information Storage and Retrieval with Dr. Caverlee. He is possibly the best lecturer I have had so far. I am excited to see where the knowledge I gained will be applicable during full-time work.
I am currently getting my last minute preparations in order before I travel to Argentina and Antarctica. I will be spending a total of two days in Buenos Aires and about eleven days on my excursion to Antarctica. I am sure that I will be detailing those travels more whenever I get back.
