description: This blog is going to start taking a different shape
---

I am going to start experimenting with different content on my blog. I have posted mostly technical, coding-based content with the _very_ occasional different subject. There is more going on in my life that I want to start keeping track of though. Topics like finance and fitness are other large areas of my life that I have learned about and want to note publicly. I do not want to stop the technical content, I just want to amend my blog. I do not imagine that the SEO gods will favor me for doing this, but that also is not the point of what I am doing.
