I have been indexed, but I am not high up in the search results at all. I was averaging rank 14 about 2 days ago, but I am now averaging around 47. Obviously students are going to put out more content which means that mine will be pushed down if I do not have high enough quality and relevance. My next move is to start linking to higher authorities. At this point, being a hub is probably my best bet. Most of those links will be included in my more dedicated [chkstong yibbibi](http://www.thomasstep.me/chkstongyibbibi.html) page. That page is higher ranked than my other pages currently, so that is where my efforts will be focused.
