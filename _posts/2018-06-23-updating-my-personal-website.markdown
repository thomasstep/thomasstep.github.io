Before this update to my website I had written a few static HTML pages that weren't too impressive especially considering the other options out there. I have recently started an internship with Viasat in College Station where I am working with React + Redux and Nodejs. My project at work inspired me to update my own webpage. At first I thought about deploying a React app to Github Pages. This is definitely an option that I am still considering mostly so I can gain more experience with React. For now, I am using Jekyll to build the static HTML pages for this website. I will keep the site updated with any new things that I do it.
