description: Introducing a new productivity app to Slack
---

My latest project has been inspired by others on Reddit. I noticed a pattern in my workflow a while back (more than a year ago really) where I would check a multitude of Slack channels for notifications. Most Slack channels do not normally apply to me but the ones that do matter need to be almost constantly monitored. The amount of notifications caused my brain to filter out the Slack notification noise, which eventually led me to miss messages. There are also new Slack channels that pop up weekly and sometimes I forget to monitor the ones that I need to. This led me to search for a solution to the problem on Reddit. There did not seem to be anyone with a tried-and-true solution, but others were experiencing the same issue. After going back and forth over DMs, I decided I was going to build an app to address this, which is the app that I am introducing here: [Slack Channel Funnel](https://channel-funnel.thomasstep.com/).

The basic piece of functionality that this introduces to Slack is filtering messages from multiple channels (target channels) down into a single channel (funnel channel). Now instead of looking through multiple Slack channels, you only need to monitor one. This also allows you to create a social media-style "feed" of your messages. It makes it easy to search back over things and see the order in which they happened. The whole goal was to make Slack easier to monitor by condensing all of your important channels down into one.

Please try out the app if this sounds like something that you also struggle with. Feedback is welcome. Together we can fight channel bloat!
