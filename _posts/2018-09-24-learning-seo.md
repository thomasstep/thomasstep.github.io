I am learning more about SEO for my information storage and retrieval class at A&M. One of the homework projects that I am working on includes trying to get a higher rank on a certain query than other students. Obviously, this can get cutthroat. This website is currently being indexed by Google, but none of my chkstong yibbibi pages are indexed. I have included the `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin to my site in hopes that I will get more visibility. I will not release the entirety of what else I have done to try and increase my ranking because I do not want other students searching chkstong yibbibi to come across this and take my ideas. After the project has concluded I will talk more about what else I have done.
