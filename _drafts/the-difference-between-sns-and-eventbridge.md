spawned from /blog/reinvent-building-next-gen-applications-with-event-driven-architecture
my approach before reinvent was to use [SNS](/blog/writing-asynchronous-Lambda-functions-with-node)
i had some experience with eventbridge but had not relied on it extensively
i also had dinner with some aws folks and struck up a conversation with a solutions architect who worked mainly with serverless and container services
he said that Lambda was in his top 5 serverless services and i naturally asked him his others. eventbridge was his number one. the reason was because without eventbridge, you could not really tap into the full integrations between services that aws offers

between my conversation and sessions, i wanted to dive more into the different use cases for sns and eventbridge in order to figure out which to use when

**when this gets done, make an edit on the reinvent notes post linking back here**
