theory that people who want to be in power should not be
people who want to be a leader can not organically become a leader; they do it too intentionally
  we all know people who are like that
true leaders just are leaders; there is something in the way that they hold themselves
people who force their way to those positions either do not do well or do not last long
people who do not necessarily want to be there but are naturally go at what they do, do the best job
  they are not greedy
  they make the right decisions
  they know how to handle the stress
this is a paradox of course because the people who want it should not have it and the people who do not want it are the best fit
there are tons of success stories of people who accidentally became ceos and business owners
  they might not have the most powerful businesses, but that does not mean that they are not successful nor that they have a quality business with good ethics and morals
  success and good ethics/morals is the defining feature that i am talking about
  being a powerful business does not mean a good person is at the helm
  elon musk might potentially be the only counter argument that i can think of

unfortunately i think the one thing that creates a large business is the root of its leader's inadequancies: consumerism
Need to establish two things here:
  without consumers there would be no business
  there is a finite amount of money that any one given person needs
    doesn't mean you can not or should not have more, it just means that after that point, you do not need more
      very personal number driven by wants/needs and luxuries
the only reason that a business leader continues to accumulate money is because the continue working
  the only reason that a business leader continues working is one of two reasons:
    they want more money (either greed or insanely high personal number needed)
    they want to continue giving to society
  those that need/want the money are the problem
  those that want to continue giving to society are not
