If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
In the same vein, if a developer writes an application and never deploys it, did the application ever exist?

This is where we get to the real reason why I am writing these Ops for Devs posts.
I have been in and out of operations roles for the past four years as a network engineer and now as a devops engineer (or whatever I would be called).
It surprised me how quickly developers would just leave operations to someone else.
When I write an application, I want to share it with others, and if I can deploy that application, I can reach people easily.
Just about everything now is either a web application or something that supports a web application.
If a developer creates an application and can't deploy it, the consumers that are left are those that find a GitHub repository and decide to build from source.
The audience is terribly limited in that case.
If that developer could deploy his application, then the consumers are anyone who has a web browser.
The potential audience is drastically increased once that application can be deployed and served to everyone with internet access.
