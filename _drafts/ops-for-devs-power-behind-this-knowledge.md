If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
In the same vein, if a developer writes an application and never deploys it, did the application ever exist?

This is where we get to the real reason why I am writing these Ops for Devs posts.
I have been in and out of operations roles for the past four years as a network engineer and now as a part time software engineer part time cloud engineer (or whatever I would be called).
It surprised me how quickly developers would just leave operations to someone else.
When I write an application, I want to share it with others, and if I can deploy that application, I can reach people easily.
Just about everything now is either a web application or something that supports a web application.
If a developer creates an application and can't deploy it, the consumers that are left are those that find a GitHub repository and decide to build from source.
The audience is terribly limited in that case.
If that developer could deploy his application, then the consumers become anyone who has a web browser.
The potential audience is drastically increased once that application can be deployed and served to everyone with internet access.
Of course, deploying something is just one piece to the puzzle.

When it comes to operations, I won't even try to claim that I know everything in the realm of operating an application.
Some of the larger topics that come to mind are CICD, application infrastructure, data stores, and logging and monitoring.
Being able to deploy an application automatically, update its infrastructure configuration when needed, knowing that your data stores are resilient and available, having good logs coming from the application, and being able to monitor the health of both the application and infrastructure in real time has power.
I'm sure that there are other important areas that should be considered, again, I'm no expert.
These are just a few common and more visible areas that I have personal experience with that I think are important for most web applications.
These are also the areas that I have enough experience with to discuss.

With the big push to move to the cloud, developers who also know ops become invaluable.
I am confident that I alone could write code and build infrastructure for most basic applications or services.
I now have an advantage over others who either only know how to run operations or only know how to write software.
Being able to say that excites me because I know what others are missing out on, and also makes me want to show others what they're missing out on.
We are living in an amazing time where a single person can create something and make it available to the world in such a short amount of time.
Having the knowledge of how to do that feels good and I hope that I can persuade and share that knowledge with others.
