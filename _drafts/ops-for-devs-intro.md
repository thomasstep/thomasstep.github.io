description: Discussing why developers should learn cloud operations
---
A year ago I never would have guessed how familiar I would become with AWS and operations at this point in time. Last year, the extent of my AWS knowledge was adding pictures to an S3 bucket while following directions for a class in college. I didn't even fully understand what S3 was, what I was doing, or the power behind the service I just took advantage of. Since then I have created, deployed, and maintained serverless APIs, front end applications, CI/CD pipelines, and analytics applications using AWS. Not only have I learned loads about cloud operations, I also learned how I show write code that is better suited for cloud applications. "DevOps" is a buzzword and I have a feeling that not everyone who calls themselves a "DevOps engineer" truly understands both sides. I understand and appreciate the push to bring development and operations closer together, but it is extremely difficult for one person to claim expert status for both roles. I have competency as a software engineer and as a cloud engineer (or whatever flavor of that word is popular now), but I know I would have a long road ahead of me if I truly wanted to be an expert at both disciplines.

The reason I am writing this is because I believe more developers should look into learning the operations side of things. As I said previously, I don't believe that everyone who says they are a "DevOps engineer" uses that title correctly, but I think that it is a good trend and push in the right direction. The way I see it, if a developer can learn the operations side of applications, that developer can write code and create infrastructure that work together instead of shoving the responsibility onto an operations team to make the infrastructure fit the application code. I am a software engineer and I like writing code, but I also understand that my code may or may not work as intended once it is deployed somewhere other than my local machine. Understanding where and how that code operates once it is deployed makes for a better application. Isn't that what we all want?

The following links will lead to the other related posts (at least the ones available when I publish the first batch). I would suggest reading through all of them as they are more-or-less intended to string together my thoughts on this subject but in smaller sizes.
