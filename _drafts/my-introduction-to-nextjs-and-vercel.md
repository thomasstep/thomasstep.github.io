title:  "My Introduction To Nextjs and Vercel"

Recently I have been working on a side project that I am building with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (I will be mostly referring to Nextjs as Next) and deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
When I started using these technologies, Vercel was actually called Zeit, but they have since changed their name.
Next was actually built by Vercel, more specifically [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/).
I have used and enjoyed other tools that he has written/created in the past, so it is no wonder I have only had positive experiences with these so far.
Before I get too deep into these technologies and why I have enjoyed using them so far I want to say this: I did not think that getting a React application running and deployed could be so easy.
When I first started this side project, I knew that I wanted to use React.
I knew that I wanted to use an Apollo server backend.
I guessed that I was going to have a hard time getting it built and deployed.
I was wrong.
After about one afternoon of looking over the [Nextjs tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and reading how to integrate [Vercel with GitLab](https://vercel.com/gitlab), I had a working application deployed and ready to view at a URL.
The last few months I have been working with AWS doing CI/CD for serverless applications, and nothing I have done has been this easy.
Granted, Next and Vercel are made by the same company, so they do have the upperhand at knowing exactly how to deploy their own product.
Even still, I am impressed with how simple they made it.
Next is intuitive and Vercel makes CI/CD simple.
If you are on the fence about trying this stack out, I highly recommend it.
Next is an opinionated framework built on top of React.
