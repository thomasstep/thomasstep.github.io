### Introduction

My name is Thomas Step and I have worked extensively with AWS for multiple years. I have run multiple production applications on AWS and I have personally created and built three complete products and multiple one-off APIs using AWS. My personal hosting costs are zero until someone pays me first to use a service. From what I have seen from others out there, I am unique in the fact that I don't pay anything until I get paid.

In this guide, I hope to pass on the concepts and methods I use to build quickly on AWS and not pay them anything until I get paid first.
