I have worked with and weeded through a lot of the aws services to bring you my opinionated list of services
these are all serverless
i have a bias towards services that only make me pay whenever i am using them
my hope is that this book will serve as a guide for newcomers and learners as well as a reference for others looking to expand their aws knowledge
this information has been in my head for a while so it feels good to get it all written down and out into the world
i will host a free version with ads on my website and i will also offer a PDF version without ads and with a bit of additional content through gumroad
