thought:
software engineering is not really about coding but rather designing and planning
if a design is well thought out and well planned then implementation will fall into place easily
i think a lot of people want to get their hands dirty with coding myself included but without a forward looking plan and good context then code is useless
code has to solve a problem and the design, features, and plan are the proper context needed to define the problem that code is solving
