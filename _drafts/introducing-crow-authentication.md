Crow authentication is a quick and easy way to integrate authentication with your application. With a simple set of APIs, you can start welcoming users without the hassle of setting up your own authentication.

I went down quite a few rabbit holes look at JWT, authentication, authorization, openid connect, oauth, the list goes on. There's a ton to digest here. It's no wonder most developers want to hand this tedious piece of web apps off to libraries and other services.
