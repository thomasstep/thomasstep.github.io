APIS: more or less just a "library" or set of functions that you invoke over the internet
FrontEnd vs. BackEnd: what youy see (pretty things) vs. all the logic and computing. Most likely you'll be BackEnd
ORM: DB abstraction: SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, etc. Most apps don't write raw SQL queries
Libraries: pip and npm are you friends. If there is a good online presence for a given library, you can probably use it. I remember not being able to use them in college, but when speed is everything, they are encouraged.
Cloud/DevOps: I'm biased but I think learning this now will only help later on. Be responsible for your code and infrastructure. Knowing how it all works together is a huge advantage.
