i can finally say i'm a triathlete

i've been training all three disciplines for a couple years now but hadn't signed up for a race because I didn't want to spend the money

swim was awful. had never swum open water

bike was fun but i thought i pushed it too much

run was better than expected after the bike and considering the heat

training wise i kept everything super simple: bike, run, bike, run, bike, long bike, long run, maybe a swim thrown in
