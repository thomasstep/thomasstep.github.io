8 August 2020:

I have never studied for an AWS certification exam before. The only thing I know about AWS certifications came from the overview page before today. I was recommended to go down this path by someone named Chris Mohritz, who I deeply respect. I don't think I have ever worked with someone who works so hard. I love hearing his stories and learning from him. He has an incredible grasp on what this whole software development thing really is and how we can use it to our advantage. I am lucky to have had the chance to work with him and have him refer me towards the same path as him.

I somewhat know AWS. My training is 100% on-the-job. Last year I knew next to nothing about AWS. The only thing I knew about AWS was that I had some pictures stored in an S3 bucket because Heroku would not let me upload static assets. I had to use a tutorial to upload those pictures to that S3 bucket. In the past year, I have helped a project get off the ground from scratch. Starting with blank AWS accounts I have learned about API Gateways, Lambdas, DNS, Databases, AWS Developer Tools for CI/CD, Jenkins, EC2s, AWS security, and lots of other things that have helped me get to where I am today. I built our APIs, crons, and other event-driven infrastructure from nothing. I feel like I have a decent starting place to begin my AWS certification exams. Who knows though.

Getting time to specifically study and learn about what will be on an exam will probably be my hardest part. This whole week I have mostly been learning about AWS services that I did not know existed from Chris. My near term goal is to soak up as much knowledge (both technical and architectural) from him while I can. What I am starting to open my eyes to is the breadth of services available that are not compute-centric. Some of the other areas are security, analytics, data storage (long and short-term), process, and machine learning. There are so many things to learn even if they will not be on an exam.

This week started with learning about CloudFront and Lambda@Edge mixed with some AWS style programming that included Lambda functions interacting with other services. One resource that I am starting to use is old re:Invent videos. Attending the conference is expensive, but they put all of their talks up on YouTube. This year's re:Invent is also online and totally free, so I will be attending some of those sessions as well.
