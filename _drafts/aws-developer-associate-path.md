8 August 2020:

I have never studied for an AWS certification exam before. The only thing I know about AWS certifications came from the overview page before today. I was recommended to go down this path by someone named Chris Mohritz, who I deeply respect. I don't think I have ever worked with someone who works so hard. I love hearing his stories and learning from him. He has an incredible grasp on what this whole software development thing really is and how we can use it to our advantage. I am lucky to have had the chance to work with him and have him refer me towards the same path as him.

I somewhat know AWS. My training is 100% on-the-job. Last year I knew next to nothing about AWS. The only thing I knew about AWS was that I had some pictures stored in an S3 bucket because Heroku would not let me upload static assets. I had to use a tutorial to upload those pictures to that S3 bucket. In the past year, I have helped a project get off the ground from scratch. Starting with blank AWS accounts I have learned about API Gateways, Lambdas, DNS, Databases, AWS Developer Tools for CI/CD, Jenkins, EC2s, AWS security, and lots of other things that have helped me get to where I am today. I built our APIs, crons, and other event-driven infrastructure from nothing. I feel like I have a decent starting place to begin my AWS certification exams. Who knows though.
