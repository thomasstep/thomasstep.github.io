by far the best documentation i have ever read
the animations bring value to the page
the message is clear and concise
the documentation makes integrating and working with their service much easier

it's worth going through an integration with stripe even if you never plan on really using them
the flow and information provided in their documentation is amazing

my personal favorite part is in the api docs specifically https://stripe.com/docs/api
they fill in the example payloads as you scroll through so you can see an actual response
for example, after i created a webhook and i went down to the https://stripe.com/docs/api/webhook_endpoints/object portion, my newly created webhook was shown
those little pieces are worth so much to me and i'm glad they put them in to enhance the documentation
