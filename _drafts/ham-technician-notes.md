make a glossary of abbreviations and codes
- CQ is an abbreviation for "seeking" as in "I'm seeking out the other stations that can hear me"
- POTA is Parks On The Air
- HT stands for handheld radio
- CTCSS is Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System which is used to open a receiver
- DCS is Digital Coded Squelch which can be used to encoded your transmission as a "secret"
- DTMF is Dual Tone Multi Frequency

notes:

- simplex is point-to-point or line-of-sight (about 5 miles) (aka not using a repeater)
- repeaters are pieces of infrastructure that exist to boost radio signals further than line-of-sight
- technicians can transmit on the 28.300 MHz to 28.500 MHz frequencies which are part of the 10 meter band
- frequencies as they related to bands:
  -
- don't interrupt anyone else on the air
- PEP is Peak Envelope Power is how strong your signal can be, technicians are capped at 200 watts in HF and 1500 watts above 30 MHz
- you are required to transmit (say) your callsign at least every 10 minutes and at the end of communication
- bands are expressed in meters which corresponds to a range of frequencies
  - the frequency range are bounded by frequencies which roughly correlate to the wavelength represented by the band
- different areas in which hams can operate are referenced by bands
- HT stands for handheld radio uv5r ft4xr
- CQ is an abbreviation for "seeking" as in "I'm seeking out the other stations that can hear me"
- q-codes are shorthand for common information https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Get%20on%20the%20Air/Comm%20w%20Other%20Hams-Q%20Signals.pdf

- modes have to do with modulation or operation
- modulation is how data is encoded into a carrier wave
- 3 common modulation modes are Frequency Modulation (FM), Amplitude Modulation (AM), or Single Sideband Modulation (SSB)
- common operating modes are Phone (voice), Digital, CW (Morse code)
