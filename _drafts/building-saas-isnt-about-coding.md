joined indie hackers
thought i could do it
coded away

nothing happened
nothing happened
nothing happened

this was a hard pill for me to swallow
building a saas isn't about coding. it's about business
you can code all you want but if you want to make money off of your code you need extra input
sure you might get one or two random internet strangers come your way but who cares

building a saas is building a business but instead of physical inventory your product is in the form of code
it doesnt change the fact that youre building a business though and you still need to sell your inventory

you need a few things that i either have learned or am in the process of learning
sales
marketing
cash flow

talk about each of them
