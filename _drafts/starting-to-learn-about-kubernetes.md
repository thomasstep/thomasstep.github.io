this has been a long time coming, but a project that i am working on will be using kubernetes
bare metal servers
while i am a huge proponent for serverless and lambda, there is no better option in my opinion
containers and kubernetes will allow us to modularize code and implement devops practices easier than the alternative which would be building VMs or running code on the bare metal which sounds archaic
