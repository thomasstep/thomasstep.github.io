last year during covid i picked running back up
ran in high school and played soccer all my life
took a couple year hiatus in my later college years
ran a marathon which was mostly me trying to make it through the miles plain and simple
i have another one coming up and im starting to learn a little more of the theory behind training

speed and endurance are the two main components that make it up
running a fast mile is something focused on speed
running a marathon is something focused on endurance
running a fast marathon is the combination of both

it seems like training plans for more beginners like the one i am on are focused on simply getting endurance up while trying to keep speed where it is naturally or even decrease it
more advanced running and runners keep the same volume but add in speed work
last year i remember wondering why in the whole marathon training plans included speed work but now i know
my first marathon time was around 4:40
this marathon i am hoping for something slightly shorter, maybe 4:20
top level marathoners run sub-2:30 which is faster than 6 minutes / mile

the weird part that i still haven't completely sorted through in my head is how separating speed work and endurance work can still be effective
i would think that working on speed over many miles would be more helpful
it appears that more people train for faster-than-race-pace speed over shorter distances and put their longer-mileage days in at slower-than-race-pace speed
the reason seems to be geared more towards not tiring out
i guess i would just need to test that kind of plan out myself to understand how my own body functions with separated speed and endurance work

moving forward in my running career i would like to continue keeping higher mileage weeks but not peak marathon fitness mileage throughout the off-season
in addition i want to try more speed work
becoming a better amateur runner should be something worked on over the course of years not within a single season
my hope is that my keeping my volume up and incorporating more and more speed work that i can decrease my mile splits on endurance runs
instead of completely separating speed and endurance work i want to use them together just at slower improvements over a longer period of time
