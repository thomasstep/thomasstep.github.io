description: Discussing what CICD is and how to use it

CI/CD is somewhat of a buzzword, but it's also been around for a while now.
I'm not really sure how to classify it, but it seems that people really want everyone else to know that they know what it is.
I recently read a [post from someone talking about how everyone says they have CI/CD but not everyone actually does](https://dev.to/canarian/let-s-stop-fooling-ourselves-what-we-call-ci-cd-is-actually-only-ci-13c).
