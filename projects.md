  <br>
  Elsewhere is a collaborative trip planning web app. Each trip is represented by a map that can be shared. Markers can be added which signify places that you want to visit while you are on your trip. This spawned from trying to organize a trip using a saved list in Google Maps, but Google does not allow collaboration on their saved lists. The project built with Next.js and deployed using Vercel for GitLab. The data is stored in MongoDB and the GraphQL API is built with Apollo server.

  <br>
  Money Grows On Trees is a blog that I created and maintain. This project is also built with Next.js. I write posts in Markdown and convert those files to HTML. I use Tailwind for styling which was a new library for me. I have plans to add in some functionality revolving around retirement and investment calculations.
