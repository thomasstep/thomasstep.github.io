	Howdy. I am a computer engineering major and German minor studying at Texas A&M University. I like to travel, learn languages, and program. I spent a year living in Germany when I was a junior in high school where I became fluent in Germany and traveled all over Europe. One of my goals is to travel to every continent. I am also a software developer. I am currently working as an intern at Viasat in College Station. I am planning on updating this site so that I can translate what I am learning into my own words. I hope that others can learn from my perspective.
