	Some of my projects have source code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasstep">GitHub</a>. I have recently completed a research project about Software Defined Networks with Dr. Guofei Gu as part of Texas A&M's honors program. I am also spending time learning Spanish as well as continuing my fluency in German.
