### FAQ

**Q:** How do I set this up?

**A:** The most straight forward method would follow these steps:
1. Create a new private Slack channel.
2. Invite `@channel-funnel` to your new private channel.
3. Tell Channel Funnel which channels you would like forwarded to your new private channel using slash commands.
4. Invite `@channel-funnel` to the Slack channels that you want forwarded to your new private channel.

**Q:** Why aren't my Slack messages forwarding after I configured Channel Funnel?

**A:** Make sure that `@channel-funnel` is added to the channels that it should be forwarding messages from. If it is not added, then it can not listen.
