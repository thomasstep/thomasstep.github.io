I"<<p>While I was trying to figure out how to add secrets from AWS Secrets Manager to CodeBuild, I could not seem to find a concrete example of a CloudFormation template that implemented this.
While it is not too complicated, I wanted to throw some actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yaml</code> up on the internet in case anyone else was looking for the same thing.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Parameters:
  MySecretAsParameter:
    Type: String
    Description: My secret used in CodeBuild

Resources:
  MySecretResource:
    Type: 'AWS::SecretsManager::Secret'
    Properties:
      Name: MySecret
      Description: My secret used in CodeBuild
      SecretString: !Sub '${MySecretAsParameter}’
  CodeBuildProject:
    .
    .
    .
    Environment:
      EnvironmentVariables:
        - Name: “MY_SECRET”
          Type: "SECRETS_MANAGER"
          Value: "MySecret"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In your buildspec file you can use this as you would normally use an environment variable in a bash command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl -H “Authorization: $MY_SECRET” …</code>.
This will keep your secrets in a secure place but still enable you to use them in your pipeline all natively in AWS.</p>
