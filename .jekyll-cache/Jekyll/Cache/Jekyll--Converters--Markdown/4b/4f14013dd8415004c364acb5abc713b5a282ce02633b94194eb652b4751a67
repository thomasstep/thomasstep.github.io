I"!<p>While trying to use Bunyan logger with Sequelize ORM, I ran across <a href="https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/issues/350">this issue on GitHub</a> that I tried to use to solve my problem.
It worked and the error that I was getting before was not there anymore; however, it was giving me extra information that I did not necessarily want.
The information it gave me was about attributes and other options in Sequelize.
I did not want to see that everytime something was logged in Sequelize though.
After some more digging, I learned that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logging</code> option in Sequelize just takes a function that it passes a message into to be logged.
I did a quick and dirty fix to this by creating a function with a message parameter and logging it with Bunyan.
It looks like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
const logger = (msg) =&gt; {
  log.info(msg);
};
...
  logging: logger
...

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logging: logger</code> part goes into your options object thatâ€™s passed in during connection.
I had not seen this solution anywhere, so I commented on the issue thread and thought I would share here as well.</p>
