I"Ž<p>The other day I spun up an RDS cluster in a VPC and wanted to connect to it to make sure everything looked correctly configured. However, since I put the cluster in a private subnet and only allowed connections from the VPC, I was not able to connect from my desktop. The solution I decided to go for was spinning up a small EC2 instance, SSHing into the EC2 instance, and connecting to my database through the CLI. Unfortunately, the default AMI does not come with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mysql</code> CLI installed. Here is how I installed it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>yum <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>yum <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> mysql-community-client
<span class="nv">$ </span>mysql <span class="nt">-u</span> MY_USER <span class="nt">-p</span><span class="sb">`</span>MY_PASSWORD<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="nt">-h</span> MY_HOST <span class="nt">-P</span> 3306
mysql&gt; show databases<span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After installing and connecting to my database, I was able to confirm that everything was up an running.</p>
