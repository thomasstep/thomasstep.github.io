I"ì<p>I have experimented with a few free hobby level platforms over the years and I wanted to round them up. I think that these are useful simply to test out a platform or idea without going overboard on paying for infrastructure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">Heroku</a> has an excellent platform for going from zero to full running application in a day. Once you understand how to use Heroku, I think the sky is the limit, and the best part is that they have 100% free options. I have run a dyno on Heroku for a Discord bot and never paid a dime for it; it just shuts off if I am reaching my monthly hobby level limit.</p>

<p>For my current side project, I am using <a href="https://vercel.com/pricing">Vercel</a> to host my Nextjs app. So far I have been blown away by Vercel, and I love that the API endpoints are hosted on serverless functions. Again, totally free, and they throw in awesome features like HTTPS, custom domain support, CI/CD, the list goes on.</p>

<p>My data layer for my Nextjs app hosted on Vercel is hosted on <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/pricing">MongoDB Atlas</a>. They offer a free Mongo cluster and it was super easy to connect with my backend through <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a>.</p>

<p>I do not think a list about cloud infrastructure would be complete without mentioning the giants: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/">Azure</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing">GCP</a>. While all of the big three have free tiers, I would warn you to be careful. I have not messed with Azure and GCP enough to incur a hefty charge, but I can say that it is extremely easy to end up with a big AWS bill at the end of the month.</p>

<p>There are tons of other cloud providers with their own set of features and specialties that I have not personally played with before but wanted to mention. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free">IBM Cloud</a> has an assortment of free tier services, and it looks like there is a way to setup a ‚ÄúLite account‚Äù, which only allows you to use free tier services. I actually like this approach since it seems like they want to give users a way to not feel paranoid about racking up a charge unintentionally. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/">DigitalOcean</a> has been a player in cloud services for a while and I have heard good things about them and their support from friends who have used them. The only difference that I can see is that they do not offer a free tier; however, their services are affordable with the lowest computing tier at $5 per month. <a href="https://www.linode.com/pricing/">Linode</a> is similar to DigitalOcean in their pricing scheme, which means that they do not have a free tier. Unfortunately, these last two cloud providers are not free, but I think that the prices are low enough and they both offer Kubernetes hosting on the cheap.</p>
