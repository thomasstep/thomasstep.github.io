Hello there. My name is Thomas Step. I am a software engineer who mainly works on backend APIs. I mostly code in Javascript/Node, but I also know C/C++, Python, Ruby, and some other lower level languages. My motivation to create and maintain this site so that I can [translate what I am learning into my own words](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579). One of my mentors from an internship brought this thought up to me and I decided to run with it. Here we are. The topics that I write about are heavily influenced on what I am currently working on and interested in. The content will probably change throughout time, but at a high level I am interested in full stack web development, devops, and security.
